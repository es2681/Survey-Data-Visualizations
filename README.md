# Survey Data Visualizations

## Summary
I worked on a research project that aims to increase the diversity and influence of community voices in policymaking by developing data-driven dialogue between community leaders, constituents, and governments. Data is collected during biannual needs assessment surveys directed at traditionally underserved communities.

The purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate my visualization skills using survey data collected between October 2023 and January 2024. Data was cleaned and weighted by race before analysis. This analysis compares survey findings for Bronx residents against residents of New York City's other boroughs (Queens, Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Staten Island). All visualizations were made using the graphic design software program [Canva](https://www.canva.com/).
