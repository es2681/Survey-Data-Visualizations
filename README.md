# Survey Data Visualizations

## Summary
I worked on a research project that aims to increase the diversity and influence of community voices in policymaking by developing data-driven dialogue between community leaders, constituents, and governments. Data is collected during biannual needs assessment surveys directed at traditionally underserved communities.

Below are visualizations developed into a 2-pager pamphlet using survey data collected between October 2023 and January 2024. Data was cleaned and weighted by race prior to analysis. This 2-pager compares survey findings of Bronx residents against residents of New York City's other boroughs (Queens, Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Staten Island). All visualizations were created using the graphic design software program [Canva](https://www.canva.com/).
